# OIBSIP: Web Developer Internship
## Task 1: Landing Page Using HTML & CSS
This is a simple landing page project using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a single page website that serves as a platform for showcasing products, services, or any other information.

## HTML Structure
The HTML code of the landing page is divided into several sections that are further broken down into smaller sections, as needed. The sections are:

1. Header: This section contains the header of the website and typically includes the logo, navigation menu, and any other header-related information.
2. Hero Section: This section is the first thing the user sees when they visit the website. It is meant to grab the user's attention and introduce the website's purpose or content.
3. About Section: This section provides information about the website, its products or services, and its mission.
4. Services Section: This section lists the services offered by the website and provides a brief description of each service.
5. Testimonials Section: This section displays customer testimonials and reviews, highlighting the benefits of using the website's products or services.
6. Contact Section: This section provides the user with the necessary information to get in touch with the website, such as a contact form, phone number, email address, or social media links.
7. Footer: This section contains the website's copyright information, any legal information, and links to other important pages on the website.

## CSS Styles
The CSS code of the landing page is responsible for the appearance of the website. It styles the HTML elements and defines the layout of the website.

The CSS code includes the following styles:

1. Typography: This includes styles for headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.
2. Colors: This includes the color scheme used throughout the website.
3. Layout: This includes styles for the layout of the website, such as defining the width of the sections, the size of the margins, and the position of elements on the page.
4. Responsiveness: This includes styles for making the website responsive, so it looks good on different screen sizes and devices.
5. Other styles: This includes styles for specific elements, such as buttons, forms, and icons.
